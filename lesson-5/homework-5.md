# Homework 3 - Assembly 1

#### 1 - Look at the example of init code in today's notes, see <a href="https://gist.github.com/extropyCoder/4243c0f90e6a6e97006a31f5b9265b94">gist</a>. When we do the CODECOPY operation, what are we overwriting ? (debugging this in Remix might help here).

#### 2 - Could the answer to Q1 allow an optimisation ?

#### 3 - Can you trigger a revert in the init code in Remix ?

#### 4 - Write some Yul to:

A - Add 0x07 to 0x08
B - store the result at the next free memory location.
C - (optional) write this again in opcodes

#### 5 - Can you think of a situation where the opcode EXTCODECOPY is used ?

#### 6 - Complete the assembly exercises in this repo <a href="https://github.com/ExtropyIO/ExpertSolidityBootcamp">exercises</a>
